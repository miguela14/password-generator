## Password Generator made with javascript

Short discription explaining the what, motivation, and how of my project:

- I have created a password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows users to generate strong and secure passwords with ease. It features a user-friendly interface where I can specify the desired length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. With just a click of a button, the generator generates a random password that meets my chosen criteria. It provides me with a convenient way to create robust passwords for my online accounts, giving me peace of mind knowing that my personal information is well-protected.

- My motivation was to create code using javascript that could manipulate the webpage into doing and meeting certain criteria.

- By creating javascript declaring variables with the appropriate functions, adding proper if statements as well as using forloops
